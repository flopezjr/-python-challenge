## PyBank ##
We were given the data set budget_data.csv. Imports os and csv so I could import the file from a different directoy and so I could you the csv functions.
I counted each row less the header to determine the number of months. I then found the total amount of profit_loss. 
The next part was tricky as you had to take the variance of the current montha nd the previous month, then we had to take the average of those variances.
used the max and min functions to find the greatest decrease and increase in the variances. Printed out the results as a text file.

## PyPoll ##

With the dataset election_data.csv. I did the same as Imported the os and csv import so I could pull the csv file.
I decided to use the counter method similar to what we did in the rock, paper, scissors excercise. I counted each time the canidate occured in the for loop.
Each time it saw the candidiate to increase by one. 
From the counter I was able to do my "math". I changed the counter to an integer so I could add up the total votes, then take the percent of each end user.
I decided to find who had the max percentage and determined them as my winner.
I printed the results to export as a text file.
